    <h3>TACC Media Complaints Collector - Help</h3>
        <p>The TACC MCC was created so the trans community and allies could make complaints to media companies and
            upload those complaints to TACC website via this plugin.  Most media companies refuse to tell us the number
            of complaints they get or what those complaints are. This tool will allow the community to fight back.</p>
        <p>The only media company this plugin currently works with is the BBC.</p>
    <h5>Submitting a complaint and saving the data</h5>
        <p>To submit a complaint you need to fill out the BBC complaints website at the following address. <a
            href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints/make-a-complaint/#/Complaint%20Summary" target="_blank">
        BBC Make a Complaint</a></p>
        <p>Follow the instruction on the BBC website and submit your complaint. The MCC will have now opened a new page
        shown below.</p>
        <img src="/help/img/submission_page.png" alt="TACC MCC Submission Page" width="40%" style="border: solid
         2px lightgrey;  display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p>There's two main parts of the submission page you're interested in. The first red box above highlights the
            optional data that you can decline to send. If this data is omitted the data will be anonymised. The second
            red box is the data that will be sent to the TACC website.</p>
        <p>To send the data press the green "Send to TACC" button.</p>
        <p>Once the data has been sent and assuming an error hasn't occurred the following will be displayed.</p>
        <img src="/help/img/sent_page.png" alt="TACC MCC Sent Page" width="40%" style="border: solid 2px lightgrey;
        display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p>Again there are two important parts to the sent data page.  The first red box shown above is a <span
                style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large; text-decoration: underline;">warning</span><em>
            you must go to your email and click on the BBC confirmation email otherwise your complaint will be discard.
            You have an approximately 60 minutes in which to do this.</em></p>
        <p>The second red box shows the status of the data sent and a unique complaint number.</p>
    <h5>MCC Dashboard and finding a previous complaint number</h5>
        <p style="display:inline-block;">The MCC Dashboard can be found on the toolbar top right and is designated with
            <img src="/help/img/mcc_t.png" width="1.2%"> in the trans colours.  If the icon is missing from chrome,
            click the jigsaw piece<img src="/help/img/jigsaw.png" width="1%"> and find the TACC Media Complaints
            Collector and click the pin to toolbar icon.</p>
        <p>Click the icon and the dashboard will open as shown below.</p>
        <img src="/help/img/mcc_dashboard.png" alt="TACC MCC Sent Page" width="40%" style="border: solid 2px;
        border-color: lightgrey; display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p><em>Note the "Check Problematic Stories" feature is not currently implemented, but will be coming
        soon.</em></p>
        <p>Top right of the dashboard you will find a link that will open this help file.</p>
        <p>In the bottom panel "Stored Complaint" you will find the complaints you have submitted to TACC.  The TACC
        Complaint Number is a clickable link which will open the
            <a href="https://tacc.org.uk/media-complaints-response-form/">Media Complaint Response Form</a> on the TACC
            website and display the full data as submitted by yourself, see below for more details.</p>
        <p>The blue delete button will remove the record from the local machine but not the website. This is so you can
        remove complaints that have either been fully actioned through the BBC complaints procedure.</p>
        <p><em>Note if you have anonymised your data and you do not keep a record of the TACC Complaint Number, TACC
            <span style="font-weight: bold">cannot</span> remove the complaints you have submitted.</em></p>

    <h5>Submitting replies from the media company</h5>
        <p>To submit a reply from the BBC, which is extremely helpful in our attempts to hold them to task. Click on the
        the TACC Complaint Number in the MCC Dashboard and the TACC Website will open with your record displayed, see
        below.</p>
        <img src="/help/img/media_complaint_response.png" alt="Media Complaints Response Form" width="40%"
             style="border: solid 2px; border-color: lightgrey; display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p>The media complaints response form will display the data you originally submitted with your complaint in the
        green Complaint Details box, below you will find the Existing Replies box.</p>
        <p>In the first red box you center the BBC provided reference number if you so wish. The reference number does
        give TACC the ability to prove the complaint was made, <em>IT DOES NOT</em> give us the ability to learn your
        personal details.</p>
        <p>The next red box is the complaint response. You can paste the email response from the BBC here. We would
        like to know their response even if it's a boilerplate response. You can also add your own notes as you please.
        </p>
        <p>The last red box is a checkbox, you must agree with the statement you have understood our privacy policy
            linked on the same line, a more easily read version is below, and tick the box to be a able to submit the
            record.</p>
        <p>When you submit the record you will be asked if you wish to submit another. If you answer no but want to
        check the entered data select NO and then perform a page refresh.</p>

    <h3>TACC Media Complaints Collector - Help</h3>
        <p>The TACC Media Complaints Collector (MCC) was created so the trans community and allies could record
            complaints about transphobia sent to UK media companies and regulatory organisations. Media companies and
            organisations refuse to supply the volume of complaints or their contents to the trans community. This
            community-led project will record complaints on the TACC website via this extension, allowing us to hold
            these media companies and organisations accountable, which is almost impossible to do currently.
        </p>
    <h5>Submitting a complaint and saving the data</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-left: 15px;">BBC</h6>
        <p>To submit a complaint to the BBC, complete the complaints form by <a
            href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints/make-a-complaint/#/Complaint%20Summary" target="_blank">
            clicking here</a>; a new tab will open.</p>
        <h6 style="margin-left: 15px;">IPSO</h6>
        <p>To submit a complaint to the IPSO, complete the complaints form by <a
                href="https://www.ipso.co.uk/making-a-complaint/step-1" target="_blank">
            clicking here</a>; a new tab will open.</p>
        <h6 style="margin-left: 15px;">Logging the complaint</h6>
        <p>Follow the instructions on the relevant complaints page as mentioned above. The MCC will now have opened a
            new page, as shown below.
            <br>(The BBC is used as an example).</p>
        <img src="/help/img/submission_page.avif" alt="TACC MCC Submission Page" width="40%" style="border: solid
         2px lightgrey;  display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p>There are two main parts to the submission page. The first red box above highlights the optional data you
            can decline to send. If you omit this data, your complaint submission to TACC will be
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">anonymised. </span>The second red box shows the data that will be
            sent to the TACC website.
        </p>
        <p>Currently you are unable to include attachments with your submission; however, you can upload collaborating
            material through the TACC website. See below for further details.</p>
        <p>Press the green "Send to TACC" button to send the data.</p>
        <p>The following will be displayed once the data has been sent, assuming an error hasn't occurred.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong><em> There is currently no built-in mechanism to recover from an error. However, if
            you do not close the page, you can attempt to submit the data again later by performing a browser refresh.
        </em></p>
        <img src="/help/img/sent_page.avif" alt="TACC MCC Sent Page" width="40%" style="border: solid 2px lightgrey;
        display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p>If the complaint is for the BBC, you will be shown a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size:
        large; text-decoration: underline;">warning</span><em> (the first red box,
            shown above). You must go to your email and click the BBC confirmation email link; otherwise,
            your complaint will be discarded. You have approximately 60 minutes to do this.</em></p>
        <p>The second red box shows the status of the data sent and the TACC Record ID.</p>
    <h5>MCC Dashboard</h5>
        <p style="display:inline-block;">The MCC Dashboard can be found on the top right of the Firefox toolbar and is designated with
            <img src="/help/img/mcc_t.png" width="1.8%"> in the trans colours.</p>
        <p style="display:inline-block;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chrome users:</span> The icon will need to be
            added to the toolbar. Click the jigsaw piece, <img src="/help/img/jigsaw.png" width="1%"> find the TACC
            Media Complaints Collector and click the pin to the toolbar icon.</p>
        <p>Click the icon and the dashboard will open as shown below.</p>
        <img src="/help/img/mcc_dashboard.avif" alt="TACC MCC Sent Page" width="40%" style="border: solid 2px;
        border-color: lightgrey; display: block; margin: auto;">
        <p><em>Note the "Check Problematic Stories" feature is not currently implemented, but will be coming
        soon.</em></p>
        <p>Top right of the dashboard you will find a link that will open this help file.</p>
        <p>Located in the bottom panel, "Stored Complaint," are details of the complaints you have submitted to TACC.
            The TACC Record ID is a clickable link to open the
            <a href="https://tacc.org.uk/media-complaints-response-form/">Media Complaint Response Form</a> on the TACC
            website and display your submitted complaint. See below for more details.</p>
        <p>Click the blue delete button to delete old complaints that have reached the end of the relevant complaints
            procedure.</p>
        <p><em>Please note that if you have <span style="text-decoration: underline">anonymised</span> your data, and
            you do not keep a record of the TACC Record ID, TACC <span style="font-weight: bold">cannot</span> remove the complaints
            you have submitted.</em></p>

    <h5>Collaborating Materials</h5>
        <p>Some media companies and organisations allow you to upload additional files with your initial complaint. To
            add additional materials to the uploaded record, open the MCC dashboard and click on the complaint's TACC
            Record ID. The Media Complaints Response Form will open.</p>
        <p>Click on the "Upload Additional Files" button shown below. You can now upload your additional materials. A
            title or short description can be given for each file you upload. Please note, however, that this
            information isn’t displayed to you in the user interface, but it can be useful for TACC when analysing your
            data. You can also upload multiple files simultaneously; but you can only assign the title or short
            description to all files uploaded at once.
        </p>
        <p>If you mistakenly uploaded the wrong file, switch to the Complaint Response page, where you can delete the
            file. See the “Responses to Complaints” section below.</p>
        <p><em>Files are not viewable, nor can you download them. This is to comply with the online safety bill.
        </em></p>
        <img src="/help/img/upload_additional_files.avif" alt="upload additional files" width="40%"
             style="border: solid 2px; border-color: lightgrey; display: block; margin: auto;">
        <h5>Responses to complaints</h5>
        <p>On the Complaint Response page below, you can add any response and additional materials you receive from the
            media company or organisation you contacted. It would be very beneficial to us if you could provide the
            responses you receive and any replies you send.  Please keep the message chain sequential and add each
            piece at a time.</p>
        <p><em>Remember, to remove any personal data from their responses or yours, if you have provided anonymised
            data.</em></p>
